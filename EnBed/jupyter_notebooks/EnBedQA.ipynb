      "Proposition Q. In an N-key priority queue, the heap algorithms require no more than `1 + lg N` compares for insert and no more than `2 lg N` compares for remove the maximum. Proof: By Proposition P, both operations involve moving along a path between the root and the bottom of the heap whose number of links is no more than `lg N`. The remove the maximum operation requires two compares for each node on the path (except at the bottom): one to find the child with the larger key, the other to decide whether that child needs to be promoted. For typical applications that require a large number of intermixed insert and remove the maximum operations in a large priority queue, Proposition Q represents an important performance breakthrough, summarized in the table shown on page 312. Where elementary implementations using an ordered array or an unordered array require linear time for one of the operations, a heap-based implementation provides a guarantee that both operations complete in logarithmic time. This improvement can make the difference between solving a problem and not being able to address it at all.\n",

There is a tradeoff between the lower cost from the reduced tree height `(log d N)` and the higher cost of finding the largest of the `d` children at each node. This tradeoff is dependent on details of the implementation and the expected relative frequency of operations.\n",

      "A useful way of thinking of this data type is as implementing an array, but with fast access to the smallest entry in the array. Actually it does even better—it gives fast access to the minimum entry in a specified subset of an array’s entries (the ones that have been inserted). In other words, you can think of an `IndexMinPQ` named `pq` as representing a subset of an array `pq[0..N-1]` of items. Think of the call `pq.insert(k, item)` as adding `k` to the subset and setting `pq[k] = item` and the call `pq.change(k, item)` as setting `pq[k] = item`, both also maintaining data structures needed to support the other operations, most importantly `delMin()` (remove and return the index of the minimum key) and `change()` (change the item associated with an index that is already in the data structure—just as in `pq[i] = item`). These operations are important in many applications and are enabled by our ability to refer to the key (with the index). Exercise 2.4.33 describes how to extend Algorithm 2.6 to implement index priority queues with remarkable efficiency and with remarkably little code. Intuitively, when an item in the heap changes, we can restore the heap invariant with a sink operation (if the key increases) and a swim operation (if the key decreases). To perform the operations, we use the index to find the item in the heap. The ability to locate an item in the heap also allows us to add the `delete()` operation to the API. \n",
      "\n",
      "Proposition Q (continued). In an index priority queue of size N, the number of compares required is proportional to at most log N for `insert`, `change` priority, `delete`, and remove the minimum. Proof: Immediate from inspection of the code and the fact that all paths in a heap are of length at most ~lg N. This discussion is for a minimum-oriented queue; as usual, we also implement on the booksite a maximum-oriented version `IndexMaxPQ`. \n",

If you have the space, you might just read them all into an array and sort them, but with a priority queue, you can read input streams and put them in sorted order on the output no matter how long they are. \n",

      "Proposition Q. In an `N`-key priority queue, the heap algorithms require no more than `1 + lg N` compares for insert and no more than `2 lg N` compares for remove the maximum. Proof: By Proposition P, both operations involve moving along a path between the root and the bottom of the heap whose number of links is no more than `lg N`. The remove the maximum operation requires two compares for each node on the path (except at the bottom): one to find the child with the larger key, the other to decide whether that child needs to be promoted. For typical applications that require a large number of intermixed insert and remove the maximum operations in a large priority queue, Proposition Q represents an important performance breakthrough, summarized in the table shown on page 312. Where elementary implementations using an ordered array or an unordered array require linear time for one of the operations, a heap-based implementation provides a guarantee that both operations complete in logarithmic time. This improvement can make the difference between solving a problem and not being able to address it at all. Multiway heaps. It is not difficult to modify our code to build heaps based on an array representation of complete heap-ordered ternary trees, with an entry at position `k` larger than or equal to entries at positions `3k-1`, `3k`, and `3k+1` and smaller than or equal to entries at position `(k+1)/3`, for all indices between 1 and `N` in an array of `N` items, and not much more difficult to use `d`-ary heaps for any given `d`. There is a tradeoff between the lower cost from the reduced tree height `(log d N)` and the higher cost of finding the largest of the `d` children at each node. This tradeoff is dependent on details of the implementation and the expected relative frequency of operations.\n",
