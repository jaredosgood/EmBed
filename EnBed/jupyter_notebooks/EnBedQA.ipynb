This information is also found in Column 2 of the MIPS Reference Data Card at the front of this book. Elaboration: What if there are more than four parameters? The MIPS convention is to place the extra parameters on the stack just above the frame pointer. The procedure then expects the first four parameters to be in registers `$a0` through `$a3` and the rest in memory, addressable via the frame pointer. As mentioned in the caption of Figure 2.12, the frame pointer is convenient because all references to variables in the stack within a procedure will have the same offset. The frame pointer is not necessary, however. The GNU MIPS C compiler uses a frame pointer, but the C compiler from MIPS does not; it treats register 30 as another save register (`$s8`).

      "ASCII versus Binary Numbers We could represent numbers as strings of ASCII digits instead of as integers. How much does storage increase if the number 1 billion is represented in ASCII versus a 32-bit integer? One billion is 1,000,000,000, so it would take 10 ASCII digits, each 8 bits long. Thus the storage expansion would be (10 * 8)/32 or 2.5. Beyond the expansion in storage, the hardware to add, subtract, multiply, and divide such decimal numbers is difficult and would consume more energy. Such difficulties explain why computing professionals are raised to believe that binary is natural and that the occasional decimal computer is bizarre. A series of instructions can extract a byte from a word, so load word and store word are sufficient for transferring bytes as well as words. Because of the popularity of text in some programs, however, MIPS provides instructions to move bytes. Load byte (`lb`) loads a byte from memory, placing it in the rightmost 8 bits of a register. Store byte (`sb`) takes a byte from the rightmost 8 bits of a register and writes it to memory. Thus, we copy a byte with the sequence\n",

C uses the third choice, terminating a string with a byte whose value is 0 (named null in ASCII). Thus, the string “Cal” is represented in C by the following 4 bytes, shown as decimal numbers: 67, 97, 108, 0. (As we shall see, Java uses the first option.)\n",

      "Elaboration: The MIPS offset plus base register addressing is an excellent match to structures as well as arrays, since the register can point to the beginning of the structure and the offset can select the desired element. We’ll see such an example in Section 2.13. Elaboration: The register in the data transfer instructions was originally invented to hold an index of an array with the offset used for the starting address of an array. Thus, the base register is also called the index register. Today’s memories are much larger and the software model of data allocation is more sophisticated, so the base address of the array is normally passed in a register since it won’t fit in the offset, as we shall see. Elaboration: Since MIPS supports negative constants, there is no need for subtract immediate in MIPS. Signed and Unsigned Numbers First, let’s quickly review how a computer represents numbers. Humans are taught to think in base 10, but numbers may be represented in any base. For example, 123 base 10 = 1111011 base 2. Numbers are kept in computer hardware as a series of high and low electronic signals, and so they are considered base 2 numbers. (Just as base 10 numbers are called decimal numbers, base 2 numbers are called binary numbers.) A single digit of a binary number is thus the “atom” of computing, since all information is composed of binary digits or bits. This fundamental building block can be one of two values, which can be thought of as several alternatives: high or low, on or off, true or false, or 1 or 0. Generalizing the point, in any number base, the value of ith digit `d_i = d * Base^i` where i starts at 0 and increases from right to left. This representation leads to an obvious way to number the bits in the word: simply use the power of the base for that bit. We subscript decimal numbers with ten and binary numbers with two. For example, `1011_two` represents `(1 x 2^3) + (0 x 2^2) + (1 x 2^1) + (1 x 2^0)_ten = (1 x 8) + (0 x 4) + (1 x 2) + (1 x 1)_ten = 8 + 0 + 2 + 1_ten = 11_ten` binary digit Also called binary bit. One of the two numbers in base 2, 0 or 1, that are the components of information.\n",
      "\n",
      "<<<Page 74>>>\n",
      "Chapter 2 Instructions: Language of the Computer We number the bits 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . from right to left in a word. The drawing below shows the numbering of bits within a MIPS word and the placement of the number `1011_two`: 31 30 29 28 27 26 25 24 23 22 21 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 (32 bits wide) Since words are drawn vertically as well as horizontally, leftmost and rightmost may be unclear. Hence, the phrase least significant bit is used to refer to the rightmost bit (bit 0 above) and most significant bit to the leftmost bit (bit 31). The MIPS word is 32 bits long, so we can represent 2^32 different 32-bit patterns. It is natural to let these combinations represent the numbers from 0 to 2^32 -1 (4,294,967,295_ten): `0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000_two = 0_ten` `0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0001_two = 1_ten` `0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0010_two = 2_ten` ... `1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1101_two = 4,294,967,293_ten` `1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1110_two = 4,294,967,294_ten` `1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111_two = 4,294,967,295_ten` That is, 32-bit binary numbers can be represented in terms of the bit value times a power of 2 (here `x_i` means the ith bit of x): `x = (...((x_31 * 2 + x_30) * 2 + x_29) * 2 + ... + x_1) * 2 + x_0` For reasons we will shortly see, these positive numbers are called unsigned numbers. Base 2 is not natural to human beings; we have 10 fingers and so find base 10 natural. Why didn’t computers use decimal? In fact, the first commercial computer did offer decimal arithmetic. The problem was that the computer still used on and off signals, so a decimal digit was simply represented by several binary digits. Decimal proved so inefficient that subsequent computers reverted to all binary, converting to base 10 only for the relatively infrequent input/output events. Keep in mind that the binary bit patterns above are simply representatives of numbers. Numbers really have an infinite number of digits, with almost all being 0 except for a few of the rightmost digits. We just don’t normally show leading 0s. Hardware can be designed to add, subtract, multiply, and divide these binary bit patterns. If the number that is the proper result of such operations cannot be represented by these rightmost hardware bits, overflow is said to have occurred. least significant bit The rightmost bit in a MIPS word. most significant bit The leftmost bit in a MIPS word. Hardware/Software Interface It’s up to the programming language, the operating system, and the program to determine what to do if overflow occurs. Computer programs calculate both positive and negative numbers, so we need a representation that distinguishes the positive from the negative. The most obvious solution is to add a separate sign, which conveniently can be represented in a single bit; the name for this representation is sign and magnitude. Alas, sign and magnitude representation has several shortcomings. First, it’s not obvious where to put the sign bit. To the right? To the left? Early computers tried both. Second, adders for sign and magnitude may need an extra step to set the sign because we can’t know in advance what the proper sign will be. Finally, a separate sign bit means that sign and magnitude has both a positive and a negative zero, which can lead to problems for inattentive programmers. As a result of these shortcomings, sign and magnitude representation was soon abandoned. In the search for a more attractive alternative, the question arose as to what would be the result for unsigned numbers if we tried to subtract a large number from a small one. The answer is that it would try to borrow from a string of leading 0s, so the result would have a string of leading 1s. Given that there was no obvious better alternative, the final solution was to pick the representation that made the hardware simple: leading 0s mean positive, and leading 1s mean negative. This convention for representing signed binary numbers is called two’s complement representation: `0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000_two = 0_ten` `0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0001_two = 1_ten` `0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0010_two = 2_ten` ... `0111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1101_two = 2,147,483,645_ten` `0111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1110_two = 2,147,483,646_ten` `0111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111_two = 2,147,483,647_ten` `1000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000_two = –2,147,483,648_ten` `1000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0001_two = –2,147,483,647_ten` `1000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0010_two = –2,147,483,646_ten` ... `1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1101_two = –3_ten` `1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1110_two = –2_ten` `1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111_two = –1_ten` The positive half of the numbers, from 0 to 2,147,483,647_ten (2^31 -1), use the same representation as before. The following bit pattern (`1000 0000 0000 0000_two`) represents the most negative number –2,147,483,648_ten (–2^31). It is followed by a declining set of negative numbers: –2,147,483,647_ten (`1000 0000 0000 0001_two`) down to –1_ten (`1111 1111 1111 1111_two`). Two’s complement does have one negative number, –2,147,483,648_ten, that has no corresponding positive number. Such imbalance was also a worry to the inattentive programmer, but sign and magnitude had problems for both the programmer and the hardware designer. Consequently, every computer today uses two’s complement binary representations for signed numbers.\n",

Given that there was no obvious better alternative, the final solution was to pick the representation that made the hardware simple: leading 0s mean positive, and leading 1s mean negative. This convention for representing signed binary numbers is called two’s complement representation:\n",

      "Chapter 2 Instructions: Language of the Computer Two’s complement representation has the advantage that all negative numbers have a 1 in the most significant bit. Consequently, hardware needs to test only this bit to see if a number is positive or negative (with the number 0 considered positive). This bit is often called the sign bit. By recognizing the role of the sign bit, we can represent positive and negative 32-bit numbers in terms of the bit value times a power of 2: `(x31 * 2^31) + (x30 * 2^30) + (x29 * 2^29) + ... + (x1 * 2^1) + (x0 * 2^0)`. The sign bit is multiplied by –2^31, and the rest of the bits are then multiplied by positive versions of their respective base values. Binary to Decimal Conversion What is the decimal value of this 32-bit two’s complement number? `1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1100two` Substituting the number’s bit values into the formula above: `(1 * 2^31) + (1 * 2^30) + ... + (0 * 2^1) + (0 * 2^0) = –2,147,483,648 + 4 = –2,147,483,644ten`. We’ll see a shortcut to simplify conversion from negative to positive soon. Just as an operation on unsigned numbers can overflow the capacity of hardware to represent the result, so can an operation on two’s complement numbers. Overflow occurs when the leftmost retained bit of the binary bit pattern is not the same as the infinite number of digits to the left (the sign bit is incorrect): a 0 on the left of the bit pattern when the number is negative or a 1 when the number is positive. Signed versus unsigned applies to loads as well as to arithmetic. The function of a signed load is to copy the sign repeatedly to fill the rest of the register—called sign extension—but its purpose is to place a correct representation of the number within that register. Unsigned loads simply fill with 0s to the left of the data, since the number represented by the bit pattern is unsigned. When loading a 32-bit word into a 32-bit register, the point is moot; signed and unsigned loads are identical. MIPS does offer two flavors of byte loads: load byte (lb) treats the byte as a signed number and thus sign-extends to fill the 24 left-most bits of the register, while load byte unsigned (lbu) works with unsigned integers. Since C programs almost always use bytes to represent characters rather than consider bytes as very short signed integers, lbu is used practically exclusively for byte loads. Unlike the numbers discussed above, memory addresses naturally start at 0 and continue to the largest address. Put another way, negative addresses make no sense. Thus, programs want to deal sometimes with numbers that can be positive or negative and sometimes with numbers that can be only positive. Some programming languages reflect this distinction. C, for example, names the former integers (declared as int in the program) and the latter unsigned integers (unsigned int). Some C style guides even recommend declaring the former as signed int to keep the distinction clear. Let’s examine two useful shortcuts when working with two’s complement numbers. The first shortcut is a quick way to negate a two’s complement binary number. Simply invert every 0 to 1 and every 1 to 0, then add one to the result. This shortcut is based on the observation that the sum of a number and its inverted representation must be `1111 1111 1111 1111two`, which represents –1. Since x + ~x = –1, therefore x + ~x + 1 = 0 or x + ~x + 1 = –x. (We use the notation ~x to mean invert every bit in x from 0 to 1 and vice versa.) Negation Shortcut Negate 2ten, and then check the result by negating –2ten. `2ten = 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0010two` Negating this number by inverting the bits and adding one, `1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1101two + 1two = 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1110two = –2ten` Going the other direction, `1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1110two` is first inverted and then incremented: `0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0001two + 1two = 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0010two = 2ten`\n",

      "Chapter 2 Instructions: Language of the Computer Most conditional branches are to a nearby location, but occasionally they branch far away, farther than can be represented in the 16 bits of the conditional branch instruction. The assembler comes to the rescue just as it did with large addresses or constants: it inserts an unconditional jump to the branch target, and inverts the condition so that the branch decides whether to skip the jump. Branching Far Away Given a branch on register `$s0` being equal to register `$s1`, `beq $s0, $s1, L1` replace it by a pair of instructions that offers a much greater branching distance. These instructions replace the short-address conditional branch: `bne $s0, $s1, L2` `j L1` L2: MIPS Addressing Mode Summary Multiple forms of addressing are generically called addressing modes. Figure 2.18 shows how operands are identified for each addressing mode. The MIPS addressing modes are the following: 1. Immediate addressing, where the operand is a constant within the instruction itself 2. Register addressing, where the operand is a register 3. Base or displacement addressing, where the operand is at the memory location whose address is the sum of a register and a constant in the instruction 4. PC-relative addressing, where the branch address is the sum of the PC and a constant in the instruction 5. Pseudodirect addressing, where the jump address is the 26 bits of the instruction concatenated with the upper bits of the PC Hardware/Software Interface EXAMPLE ANSWER addressing mode One of several addressing regimes delimited by their varied use of operands and/or addresses. Although we show MIPS as having 32-bit addresses, nearly all microprocessors (including MIPS) have 64-bit address extensions (see Appendix E and Section 2.18). These extensions were in response to the needs of software for larger programs. The process of instruction set extension allows architectures to expand in such a way that is able to move software compatibly upward to the next generation of architecture.

The operands are shaded in color. The operand of mode 3 is in memory, whereas the operand for mode 2 is a register. Note that versions of load and store access bytes, halfwords, or words. For mode 1, the operand is 16 bits of the instruction itself. Modes 4 and 5 address instructions in memory, with mode 4 adding a 16-bit address shifted left 2 bits to the PC and mode 5 concatenating a 26-bit address shifted left 2 bits with the 4 upper bits of the PC. Note that a single operation can use more than one addressing mode. Add, for example, uses both immediate (addi) and register (add) addressing.\n",

      "Chapter 2 Instructions: Language of the Computer Decoding Machine Language Sometimes you are forced to reverse-engineer machine language to create the original assembly language. One example is when looking at “core dump.” Figure 2.19 shows the MIPS encoding of the fields for the MIPS machine language. This figure helps when translating by hand between assembly language and machine language. Decoding Machine Code What is the assembly language statement corresponding to this machine instruction? `00af8020hex` The first step in converting hexadecimal to binary is to find the op fields: (Bits: 31 28 26 5 2 0) `0000 0000 1010 1111 1000 0000 0010 0000` We look at the op field to determine the operation. Referring to Figure 2.19, when bits 31–29 are 000 and bits 28–26 are 000, it is an R-format instruction. Let’s reformat the binary instruction into R-format fields, listed in Figure 2.20: op rs rt rd shamt funct `000000 00101 01111 10000 00000 100000` The bottom portion of Figure 2.19 determines the operation of an R-format instruction. In this case, bits 5–3 are 100 and bits 2–0 are 000, which means this binary pattern represents an add instruction. We decode the rest of the instruction by looking at the field values. The decimal values are 5 for the rs field, 15 for rt, and 16 for rd (shamt is unused). Figure 2.14 shows that these numbers represent registers `$a1`, `$t7`, and `$s0`. Now we can reveal the assembly instruction: `add $s0,$a1,$t7` EXAMPLE ANSWER\n"
